https://t.co/yItsr1hBKL #fitness #running #aquaticexerciseI ran a third less miles in 2022 than the previous year (because of… well, life) but this one took me over 1000 miles and I reckon next year will be better🤞#running https://t.co/0OpvcjtB60Our next beginners’ #running course is coming up!

My worst total since 2019 but I've still enjoyed every time I got out there. A change in priorities, illness &amp; injuries have led to less miles in the bank. My resolution for 2023 is to get a better balance &amp; have less injuries 🤞

#running #Northumberland https://t.co/36cMk3HkqYMany beginner runners call a 5k a 5k marathon and most of us experienced runners find it cringy. 

I realised there is no way they are expected to know otherwise. 

The best thing is to gently correct them and let them bask in the glory!

If you don't know who, it's you. Obviously 🤣Make sure you can feel the warmth in your feet before starting your run! Running on cold joints/tendons lead to injuries! #running #ultrarunningChristmas Eve parkrun and kicked off week 4 of #C25K #running #runuptochristmas #teachersrunclub #parkrun slow and steady wins the race for me these days and allows me to continue running #iloverunning #ilovesantatoo https://t.co/YARRXsqwQrDon't use all this snow as an excuse. 
Get your run in no matter what. If you have to run in the snow,do it! If you have to on a treadmill, just do it!
JUST RUN!

Running burns calories so when u 1st start running u may lose weight. But the more u run, the more energy efficient your body becomes, so u don’t burn as many calories to get u through the kms. #runcoach #runchat #running #runOtw to Kallang meetup point for HM run with Arifah @arxfahhxn and Rovina @dayungvivi

1. Consistency is the secret sauce 
2. Celebrate the finish line, but fall in love with the training
3. Run easy most of the time, run hard a bit, this power allows one to tap into the aerobic base better/longer https://t.co/8LSsruuMR4Fri-yay! My weekly fitness blog!

3. Think about your shortcomings and future goals.

Had done a 20k on Thu so probably that had its impact.

Marathon training is a demanding task, but the fun is in these mini victories and micro progresses that we make.

Have been a great Sunday cause I started the 21k plan!! Happy to be back at it! 
#garmin #running #fitness #exercise https://t.co/BhnYhIkFxKHave consistency, a sane approach, moderation and making your #running an enjoyable, rather than dreaded, part of your life.Which has rather undone the whole point of the, you know, long run. 
But then it is almost Christmas.
On the other hand…. Just six weeks to go!!! Eeeek!!!

That’s the #running news. You can go back to the football now. https://t.co/Hfa2X3hgtW@TheMirnavator Looks amazing out there!

#runchat #running #trailsWell, it’s the afternoon’s sporting update you’ve all been waiting for…
In #running news this week, it has been 50k of very cold running.  Not all at once, of course. No.
Four individual very very cold runs.
The cold has its beauty, of course. Bright blue skies. https://t.co/RhMGZGwvkCSo nice to see the ☀️ again on my Sunday morning run. #ChicagoWeather #runningAction shot 📸

Not in the best shape and piled on the weight but good to be back racing after a long and tough few months post London Marathon.

But running is my medicine and it was good to be back.

I’m always trying to following like minded tweeters and it’s added motivation to see others achieving goals! 🏃🏼‍♂️If possible Split up the distance. Follow six miles approach an hour. (1mile = 1.6 km)
Change the settings to miles/hr..this will help you push half a km more at recurring pace. 30 km within 3 hours easily doable.

#buongiorno #Milano #run #running #runner https://t.co/P4TdiVOIuc"Just finished a 10k race and feeling accomplished! Running has become a huge part of my life and I'm grateful for the mental and physical benefits it brings." #10k #running #fitnessI realized the elevation (150+ mtrs in total) after saving the workout. And happy that I ran on most of the elevations 😬

Today's run was more focused, a little easier than earlier long runs and felt good afterward too.

#running #training #marathonBroke the mental as well as physical barrier of 30K today 🤘

The plan was to run 4 x 8K sessions in 4 hours. Fell short of it by some time, but content that I could finish 30K without any hiccups.

Thanks in advance! #running #strava #runchat🏃 A treadmill is a great option if you are only interested in cardiovascular benefits. Running outside, however, will be more beneficial if you're training for a race.

If you have running fomo like me, here’s a short reminder to make sure you’re doing it for the right reasons. #running  https://t.co/mkaIXSbvWJUnderstanding Effort &amp; Pace while #Running:

The difference between EFFORT and PACE:  Pace is simply a measure of movement on the ground.  Pace is a constant for every runner.  Effort is HOW that pace is achieved.  Effort varies from person to person.So stunning that I had to stop and take photos. (Yes, I stopped my watch! 🤣) #trails #mendiphillsaonb @MendipHillsAONB #running #somerset https://t.co/MWfakwR6zTThe #running season on the vast open #sea is about to start. https://t.co/PKxJTN0ULoWhat a beautiful 13 mile run with @Rebecca1Walks 🏃🏽‍♀️🏃🏽‍♀️ Quick half in the Woolpack - kidding 😂😂🎅🎄🎅#running @emmerdale 🎄🎅⭐️ https://t.co/MW45wO9CteNothing like cooking chicken for the day at in the morning!

#StrengthTraining https://t.co/Ns5zUIIiWaAnd f-i-n-a-l-l-y, 1 WHOLE KG lost. (Without 4 weeks of #running...😳Yeah, tell me about it 🙄🤦🏻‍♀️) It's been 4 days of really hard training sessions to shift just 1, where are those days  you'd 'think diet' &amp; lose 1.6 in a day?! Hello 2, I'm coming for you in the next 10 days! 🤣I became rackless last week. A little overdrinking in a party, didn't adhere to my daily water intake and didn't sleep well. Result: Running felt harder than usual. Its easy to slip down and undo the progress. A good runner needs to be conscientious.

#IndieGameDev #gamedev https://t.co/cuU4UYU2dUIt's a question that has puzzled runners for years. Why is the first 10 minutes of running so hard? After all, you've been sitting around all morning, so how can just 10 minutes of running be that difficult? #running

This will be my 6th. But no worries, it’s downhill! And because my insanity is rational, also registered for a downhill half here in Colorado. #runningAt @RunThroughUK Southampton #10K this morning, despite not feeling well this week I managed a PB!

In 2017, I was 40 pounds overweight. I ran 5 miles a day for a year. The last 6 months 7 miles a day. I did learn how to control portions because running makes you hungrier.2.9 Degrees, the top was iced over! Hard going but felt unreal after.

It was a tough decision to make
For the doctors
To finally break
The sad news
About the condition
Of the young patient
They were
#running out of reasons
To keep
The relatives 
In the dark.
Nothing more could be done now
Only prayers for

#running #wellbeing #sportsinjuriesPeople who spit on #running tracks: are you OK? Is everything good at home? #runnerproblemsReview of the year part 1. This week I go for a run and talk about why I decided I needed to be a bit greener. (And it’s nothing to do with Greta.)

https://t.co/1VuWef2zcFThe kinda heavy breathing I like. #Running #RunningMan #RunningWithTumiSole #sports #exercise #Health https://t.co/OTtSTVBq5e“Uplink underground, uplink underground. If you say that one more time, I’ll uplink your ass, and you’ll be underground!” Luckily for the running man there are ladders and lots of them to get him out of tight spots. Play Lode Runner, it’s gold! #ZXSpectrum #retro #8bit #running https://t.co/zAcSBit8iBVery cold 🥶 but sunny 🌞 afternoon run 🏃‍♀️
